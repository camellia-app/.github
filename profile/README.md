## Hi there üëã

This is an official GitHub organization related to browser extension called Camellia. With Camellia installed in your browser, when you create a new tab, Camellia will be opened instead of default browser‚Äôs new tab page. Instead of traditional non-functional new tab pages, Camellia shows you all your native browser bookmarks in convinient way. If you wish to know more about the project, check out [camellia-app/camellia](https://github.com/camellia-app/camellia) repository.

Camellia is free and fully open source project. This GitHub organization used for full development cycle of the project:

* It holds source code repositories for all components used to run the project: browser extension itself and Cloudflare Workers required for some functionality.
* We use GitHub Issues as a task tracker.
* Next, visit [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/camellia-app/discussions) to chat about anything related to the project.
* Also, check out [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/camellia-app/projects) in the organization.

Camellia was designed and developed by [Petr Flaks](https://github.com/flaksp) with help of awesome contributors ‚ù§Ô∏è
