# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only last versions of our products are supported. They are designed to let users run only latest version of software.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please, do not expose public security issues, report them directly to core maintainers instead. You can do it in two ways:

- Open repository which contains vulnerability, click "Security" tab and then report the problem using "Private vulnerability reporting". This is recommended way to report vulnerabilities.
- You may contact Petr Flaks, which is core maintainer: petr@flaks.dev

We will do our best to fix them as fast as possible.
